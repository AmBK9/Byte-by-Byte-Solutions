# Byte by Byte Solutions
[Byte by Byte](www.byte-by-byte.com) is a coding interview prep website that provides many practice interview questions as well as detailed explanations. This repo contains working, tested code for the solutions on Byte by Byte.

### Contributing
I would love to compile solutions to all of the problems here, as well as offer solutions in different languages. Currently we only have Java solutions but Python, C, or any other languages would be most welcome. Just create a pull request with your changes. And make sure your code includes at least a few tests!
